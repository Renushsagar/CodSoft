# Codsoft-Task1-CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
The tasks for this project is to build a machine learning model to identify
fraudulent credit card transactions.
Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression and random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) for improving results.
